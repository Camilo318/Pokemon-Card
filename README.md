# Pokemon-Card
It is a memory game, flip a card and try to find its pair. The cards will be shuffle every time a new game is started.
The Pokemons are from the first generation, I will add more Pokemons if I can find nice icons

## Features
* This game was created using an OOP approach.
* The algorithm used to shuffle the cards is Fisher-Yates
* Vanilla JS.. for the most part. I used SweetAlerts for providing feedback
* Animations and sounds

The sounds are extremely hard to find. As soon as find them I will add 'em.

In the mean time Catch them all!
